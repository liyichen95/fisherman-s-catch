# Fisherman's Catch
An interactive kids game app created with ZIM framework.

# Introduction
My group Interactive Coding project in the Interactive Media Management program. Our goal for this game was to make an educational based interactivity app that allows kids can play and learn from. That's where the concept of learning how to spell words came to mind. 

We wanted a fun, multi-vibrant coloured theme that was playful, inviting, and cute (why not?! ;'}). The group and I decided to base the theme of the game around a fishing environment. The story follows the main character (Mr. Fox) out to catch fish to sell at his market, and the game ends up at the main character's market once the player has completed all three levels. 

The level of difficulty increases as the player progresses to the next level, with a total of 3 levels. The word length increases to represent the level of difficulty but the user is provided an image to represent what that word is. The player is to catch the corresponding letter in the lake to spell out the correct word. 

# App Functionality 
The project requirements includes working around our creativity and utilizing concepts taught in class using ZIM â€” an open source JavaScript Framework for the HTML Canvas. ZIM is powered by CreateJS and adds many components and controls when making creative games/apps.
